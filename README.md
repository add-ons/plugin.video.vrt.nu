# plugin.video.vrt.nu

**plugin.video.vrt.nu** is a [Kodi][1] add-on used to watch all live video streams *and* all video-on-demand
content available on [VRT NU][2].

VRT NU is the video-on-demand platform of VRT, Flanders' public broadcasting service.

## Installing

In Kodi, simply search for `VRT NU`, and install the add-on.

Alternatively, you can download a ZIP archive from the [Kodi plugin page][3] and install it directly in Kodi
using the **Install via Zip** option.

## Using the plugin

The [VRT NU][2] platform requires users to sign in before gaining access to video-on-demand content. Users can
sign in with a user name and password, or sign in with their Google, or Facebook account.

This plugin currently only supports signing in using the first method (user name and password). If you already
have a VRT NU account and sign in with another method, it's easy to get a password:

- Sign out of your VRT NU account;
- Click **Inloggen met e-mail**;
- Click the **Wachtwoord vergeten?** hyperlink, and enter your email address.

You'll receive an email that allows you to set a password. Use that password to enter in the plugin when
prompted.
